# Allotment Adventure (aka Data-Game)
Portfolio Project WIP - Collect player actions and have exportable results through JSON and CSV files. 

Currently working on a game demo which tracks player interactions in the scence - which objects they interact with and what "tasks" they accept through the NPC. 

I am aiming to collate and display this data with an on-screen dashboard for the player, and also I am going to create JSON and CSV files to export the data. 

I was inspired by Scoutible's soft-skills analysis gaming app so I'm developing my own demo that displays data reporting from player interaction.
