# Data-Game-V2
Portfolio Project WIP - Collect player actions and report on varied results through UI

Currently working on a game demo which tracks player interactions in the scence - which objects they interact with and what "tasks" they agree to through the NPC. 

I am aiming to collate and display this data with an on-screen dashboard for the player, and also I am going to create an export file. 

I was inspired by Scoutible's soft-skills analysis gaming app so I'm developing my own demo that displays data reporting from player interaction.
